## Mogwai does Advent of Code (2021)
This is my first year doing Advent of Code (due to the fact that in previous years, I didn't know my ass from a hole in the ground. As far as that situation goes, I still don't, but I'm at least trying.)

A lot of my solutions (actually, all of them) are time (and space) inefficient in obvious ways, and I'd fix them if I had the time, but I'm more focused on making this as easy as possible (rather than as _smart_ as possible, because that sort of cognitive enterprise will burn me out, and make me quit early).

So here's my repo. Fork it, mangle it, leave questions if you don't know why I did what I did.

I'll continue to add to this repository until I give up on Advent of Code.
